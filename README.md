# Important Notes:


- To generate a PBR Terrain with code, see this example
https://github.com/yaRnMcDonuts/AfflictedPbrTerrainConverter/blob/master/PBRTerrain/TestPBRTerrain.java#L59


- to use the TerrainShaderConverter (previously contained in this project), you will now need to use the ASDUtilities library in your project https://github.com/yaRnMcDonuts/ASD-Utilities
